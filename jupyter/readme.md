To automatically start Jupyter Notebook when your Raspberry Pi boots up, you can create a systemd service. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create a systemd Service File**:
   Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi and run the following command to create a new systemd service file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/jupyter.service
   ```

   This will open the Nano text editor with the new service file.

2. **Add Service Configuration**:
   Paste the following configuration into the Nano editor:

   ```plaintext
   [Unit]
   Description=Jupyter Notebook

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 --NotebookApp.token=''
   WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/notebooks  # Replace with your actual notebook directory
   User=pi  # Replace with your username

   [Install]
   WantedBy=default.target
   ```

   Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/notebooks` with the actual path where you want to store your Jupyter notebooks, and replace `pi` with your username.

3. **Save and Exit**:
   Press `Ctrl + X`, then press `Y` to confirm saving the changes, and press `Enter` to confirm the filename.

4. **Reload systemd Manager Configuration**:
   After creating the service file, reload the systemd manager configuration to recognize the new service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

5. **Enable and Start the Service**:
   Enable the service to start at boot and then start it:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable jupyter.service
   sudo systemctl start jupyter.service
   ```

6. **Check Service Status**:
   You can check the status of the service to make sure it's running without errors:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status jupyter.service
   ```

   You should see output indicating that the service is active and running.

Now, Jupyter Notebook should start automatically every time your Raspberry Pi boots up. You can access the notebook interface by opening a web browser and navigating to the IP address of your Raspberry Pi, followed by the Jupyter Notebook port (default is 8888). For example, `http://raspberry_pi_ip:8888`.

Please note that running Jupyter Notebook with no authentication token and allowing connections from any IP address (`--ip=0.0.0.0`) can be a security risk if your Raspberry Pi is accessible from the internet. Be sure to take appropriate security measures to protect your system if you plan to expose it to external networks.
